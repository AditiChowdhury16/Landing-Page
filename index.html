                    <br><br>
                    <p>Whether aiming for a specific goal or just struggling to survive, the main character is thrust into unfamiliar situations or lands and continuously faces unexpected dangers. The narrative of adventure stories is always on how the characters react to sudden events or trials during the journey, indicating personal growth or setback based on which actions or choices are taken.</p>

                    <br><br>
                    <p>Uplifting the audience with positive emotion takes priority, eliciting laughter, amusement, or general entertainment. Almost always, comedy stories are episodic or have happy endings.Nearly every work will use comedy as a plot device to relieve tension, but the overarching narrative must be focused on evoking amusement to be Comedy. Drama and Comedy are not mutually exclusive, but mixing them requires the audience facing human struggle with lightheartedness. Slice of Life and Comedy are incompatible by definition.</p>

                    <p>There are no supernatural elements. Instead, characters lead ordinary lives, like you and all of us. And just like us, they go through some hard times, like when they fall hopelessly in love with someone who doesn’t love them back. Sadly, we’ve probably all been there.</p>
